# LAB REPORT 5
**_By Zichen Wang_**

This Lab Report illustrates the updated and enhanced version on **the script about grading**.
> Thus, this report is based on report 6 - about the editting and updating bash scripts.

## The Required Bash Script
```
CPATH='.:../lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:../lib/junit-4.13.2.jar'

# clone the repository of the student submission
rm -rf submissions
rm -rf tests
git clone $1 submissions
echo 'Finished cloning'

# check the student code has the correct file(s) submitted.
if [ ! -f ./submissions/ListExamples.java ]; then
    echo "You might have the wrong file submitted, please do check again!"
    exit 1
fi

# Copy the student submission out of the submissions folder, and put it to the tests folder
mkdir ./tests
cp ./submissions/ListExamples.java ./tests
cp ./TestListExamples.java ./tests

cd tests
# Compile the student's code and test files
javac -cp $CPATH *.java

# Check if compilation succeeded
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Compilation failed"
    exit 1
else 
    echo "Compilation Done!"
fi

# Run the tests using JUnit and report the grade

java -cp $CPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples > tests_results.txt
grep -o "FAILURES" tests_results.txt > grep_result.txt
if [ -s grep_result.txt ]; then
    echo "Sorry, you failed the tests."
    cat tests_results.txt
else
    echo "Congrats, well done!"
    cat tests_results.txt
fi

exit 0
```

## The Tests provided for running
>Based on week 6 lab page, following tests are required for my `grade.sh` script:

1) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3, which has the same code as the starter from lab 3

2) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected, which has the methods corrected (I would expect this to get full or near-to-full credit)

3) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error, which has a syntax error of a missing semicolon. Note that your job is not to fix this, but to decide what to do in your grader with such a submission!

4) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature, which has the types for the arguments of filter in the wrong order, so it doesnâ€™t match the expected behavior.

5) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename, which has a great implementation saved in a file with the wrong name.

6) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-nested, which has a great implementation saved in a nested directory called pa1.

7) https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-subtle, which has more subtle bugs (hints: see assertSame, which compares with == rather than .equals(), and think hard about duplicates for merge)

## General Workflow:
> Since the SSH key gen has been provided for my personal computer that I am working on, the process for logging in will be ignored.

1. Based on reviews and assitance form classmates and Tutors, I have adjusted my codes and finished the remaining of the scripts.
2. It is always possible to remove unnecessary outputs from my terminal by removing `echo` from my script, but for clarification I maintained those stuff.
3. To make sure it works on all files, I used all the 7 tests provided in the lab page.

## Results of tests:

**1. list-methods-lab3, which should fail the test**
